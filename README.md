# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to understand how to use Machine Learning statistical algorithms to make predictions based on historical data. We split the data into training and testing datasets and monitor their Accuracy, Precision and Sensitivity results. In this particular case we will be using the data provided to us to Train a ML
